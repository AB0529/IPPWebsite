    Once you are nearing the end of your first year in Inovatoin Pathways you will have opportunities throughout the year for internships. You are required in your first year of Inovation Pathways to take a internship during the summer. Also these internship can also pay you. These internships will only be available for the people who are taking that career. For example if you are in the health career course all of the internships for health and nursing will only apply to those students taking that course. All of these internships can be found in the google classroom also Mr. Weymouth will also send emails to students about internship opportunities because they are limited spots so you would want to sign up real quick so you can get an interview and get started with your intership. For the second year there will also be a lot of opportunities like the first for internships. This internships will all be found in the google classroom and Mr. Weymouth will also notify students about internships. But for the second it's different because in the second year you have 2 options either do a internship or do a capstone project for the summer.</p>
