    <h2> Computational Artifact(Step One)</h2>
    <p style="font-size:15px;"> <strong>Provide information on your computing innovation and computational artifact.</strong> The college Board Explore Task requires a computer innovation example or articfact to be expressed and presented for the project. 
    The College Board Explore Task directions  ask you to "analyze a computing innovation's impact on society, economy, or culture and explain how this impact could be beneficial and/or harmful." When you are thinking about innovations that you might use for your own submission, reflect on how well you'll be able to use that innovation to complete the Explore Task Directions. <p>

      <h2> 3</h2>
    <p style="font-size:15px;">The Explore Task directions ask you to "explain how a computing innovation consumes, produces, or transforms data." You only need to do one of these for your innovation. After you have drafted your response to the Explore Task, take time to make sure you are addressing the data explanation completely. Make sure that your response is clear about the specific kind of data that you are describing. Make sure you don't to mix up the data with the innovation. Make sure you don't to mix up the data with the part of the innovation that collects the data. Make sure you describe how the data are used.
