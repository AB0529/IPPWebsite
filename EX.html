                            <p style="font-size: 15px;"> <strong>Provide information on your computing innovation and computational artifact.</strong> The college Board Explore Task requires a computer innovation example or articfact to be expressed and presented for the project.
                                The College Board Explore Task directions ask you to "analyze a computing innovation's impact on society, economy, or culture and explain how this impact could be beneficial and/or harmful." When you are thinking about
                                innovations that you might use for your own submission, reflect on how well you'll be able to use that innovation to complete the Explore Task Directions.

                            <p style="font-size:15px;">When researching your topic you need to make sure the information you are using is correct and is properly credited. Another thing to note is it's very easy to go off topic and get mixed info so it's very important to stay
                                with your original claim.You can have as much research as you want about your topic but it is recommended that you would have read 3-5 articles of information.

                            <h2> Describing Your Innovation's Data(Step Three)</h2>
                            <p style="font-size:15px;">The Explore Task directions ask you to "explain how a computing innovation consumes, produces, or transforms data." You only need to do one of these for your innovation. After you have drafted your response to the Explore Task,
                                take time to make sure you are addressing the data explanation completely. Make sure that your response is clear about the specific kind of data that you are describing. Make sure you don't to mix up the data with the innovation.
                                Make sure you don't to mix up the data with the part of the innovation that collects the data. Make sure you describe how the data are used.
                                <p>

                            <p style="font-size:15px;">The College Board Explore Task directions ask you to "describe how data storage, data privacy, or data security concerns are raised based on the capabilities of the computing innovation." Make sure that the concern you describe
                                is actually related to the data. Make sure that the concern is real. With new technologies, people get concerned about all kinds of things that can't really happen. Be sure your describe a concern that's actually legitimate.

                            <h2> Citing Your Sources(Step Five)</h2>
                            <p style="font-size:15px;">Whenever you do research, you need to cite (acknowledge) the sources of your research. This helps readers know where to go for more information and how much of what you say is your own thinking vs. someone else's (neither is
                                better, but it's important to be clear what is what). You can use quotes from your sources, in which case you have to copy the text exactly and use quotation marks around the copied text. Or you can describe what you learned
                                from your sources in your own words, in which case you don't need quotation marks and can't copy the text exactly.

                                of a computational artifact specifically for learning about the end goal of thier lessons and labor. For the use of learing of real life exampples and applications of actual lessons, students work and take the Explore Task
